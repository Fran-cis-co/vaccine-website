# Vaccine website

Vaccine website using java, html, and SQL. The purpose of this website is to display patients and how many doses of the vaccine they have taken/which type of vaccine they took (Johnson, Moderna, etc).
This website allows the hypothetical admin to see the patients, add new patients, and update how many doses of the vaccine they have taken. This website also takes into how much the hospital has stock of each vaccine.
If the hospital does not have a certain vaccine, a new patient will not be allowed to be displayed that they have taken the Moderna vaccine since it is out of stock. Likewise for adding more doses, the website will not allow this.
However, the website allows to update the stock of the vaccines as well.

Unfortunately, this website cannot be functioning as the sql server no longer works, but this is the source code.
